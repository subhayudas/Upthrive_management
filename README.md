## 🔐 Authentication & Authorization

The system uses Supabase for authentication with role-based access control:

- **Client**: Can only access their own data and submit requests
- **Manager**: Full access to all data and CRUD operations
- **Editor**: Can view assigned tasks and submit work

## 📊 Database Schema

### Core Tables

- `profiles` - User profiles with roles
- `clients` - Client information
- `cc_list` - Content calendar items
- `requests` - Client requests to managers
- `tasks` - Editor assignments and submissions
- `client_reviews` - Client approval tracking

### Key Relationships

- Each client has their own CC list
- Requests flow from Client → Manager → Editor → Manager → Client
- Tasks track the complete workflow with status updates

## 🔄 Workflow

### 1. Client Request Flow

1. Client submits request with message and optional image
2. Manager reviews and assigns to editor
3. Editor completes work and submits
4. Manager reviews and approves/rejects
5. If approved, client reviews and approves/rejects
6. If rejected, task returns to previous step

### 2. CC List Management

- Managers can create, read, update, delete CC items
- Clients can only view their own CC list
- Editors can view all CC lists for reference

## 🎨 UI/UX Features

- **Responsive Design** - Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile
- **Role-based Navigation** - Different menus for different user types
- **Real-time Status Updates** - Visual status badges and progress tracking
- **Image Upload** - Support for multiple image formats
- **Toast Notifications** - User feedback for all actions
- **Loading States** - Smooth user experience during API calls
